The purpose of this project is to create a type of sketchpad using jQuery. I
will create a grid with user-defined dimensions that can be colored in by either
mousing over or clicking the grid squares. I will include options to change the
color, as well as the amount of color to add with each 'stroke'. A reset button
will erase the contents of the grid, and a re-sizing option will allow the user
to specify a new set of dimensions for the grid. Time permitting, I will
implement a feature that will allow the user to save their sketches as jpeg
images.
